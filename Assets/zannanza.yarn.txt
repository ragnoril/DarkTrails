<<set_dialog_image kemet_messenger>>
It all started with one messenger from Kemet bringing a letter from the Queen:

"My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons."
"You might give me one of your sons to become my husband." 
"I would not wish to take one of my subjects as a husband... I am afraid." said the Queen.

It was too good to be true. My father couldn't belive his good fortune and suspected a trap. 

He sent emissaries telling them:

"Go and bring your the true word back to me. Maybe they deceive me. Maybe in fact they do have a son of their lord."

But there were none. Queen of Kemet was giving her country to save herself:

"I have written to no other country, only to you have I written."
"They say your sons are many: so give me one son of yours. To me he will be husband, but to Kemet he will be king."

As an ambitious man my father was he couldn't let himself let go of this opportunity. 

He gathered his sons and the his council the Panku.

You could see the excitement in his eyes, but he was a cautious man as well.

"Such a thing has never happened to me in my whole life" said my father.

Then he asked us what do we think about this proposition.

When it was my turn i said...

[[This is a great opportunity father, we have to seize it!|Opportunity]]

"Do not be so keen to accept gifts, my son." 

"Especially the ones that comes from your enemies." said my father.

"Even if it is not a trap still the journey alone shall be perilous."

"But since you are so eager to graps this opportunity i shall accept your request."

"It shall be you who will be the next Pharoah of Kemet!"

[[It will be my honour father.|AcceptFate]]

"I have sent many messengers to her."

So this proclamation my world changed forever.

It was a great boon and a great peril that bestowed upon me.

A small squad of guards was going to accompany me, as this was a peaceful mission. 

The captain of the guards was Tarkuwa, my childhood friend.

Also the scribe Hattu-Zilli was with us as our translator.

We were almost ready to go.

The great king stood a little bit alone from all those people around him.

I approached, gave a bow and asked:

"My king, the preparations are nearly done."

"I have come to ask do you have any more wishes before we left?"

He smiled and said "No my son, may the gods be with you on your journey!"

He looked happy but i could see the anxiety in the corner of his eyes.

Arnuwanda said "Make us proud little brother."

Mursili said "May the gods be with you my brother."

We all wished Telipinu was with us too.

They warned me not to forget to visit Piyasilli. Our brother, the king of Charchemish.

We talked and joked and smiled. I never knew i much i would miss them.

Holy priests and priestesses were there too. 

To the Sun-Goddes of Arinna and the Storm God Teshub and all the other thousand gods of the Hatti.

They made sacrifical offerings, perform sacred rituals and pray for a safe journey for us.

Common folk was there too.

Every one was there to send us away.

Last couple of days were uneventful but one day i found a dog on the roadside.

It looked hungry enough but tried to stay away in a safe distance from us.

With no near villages or cities, the dog started to tail us.

[[I took pity the dog. So i started to leave some food for it nearby whenever we camp.|PetTheDog]]

Scouts returned with the news of some raiders along with the slaves they dragged along.

Maruaders, cutthroats, lawless men. Preying on weak...

They attack on small villages. Kill, pillage and capture those left alive.

Tarkuwa eagerly asked my permission, "My lord, let me and my warriors teach those dogs a lesson!"

Hattu-Zili were cautious. "My lord, we shall follow your will but we have a more grave mission at hand. Choose wisely."

I gave the order and the attack began. We gave them no quarter and kill to the last men.

My men were overjoyed with sense of victory and fulfilling justice.

We freed all the people they took as slaves.

But my men told me that a young girl has a request from me.

I ask them the bring the girl before me.

She didn't looked like she has seen much more than twenty winters.

Even the dust and dirt of the road and slavery she was forced into couldn't hide her natural beauty.

After observing her briefly i allowed her to speak.

She told me her story. How she lived with her family in a farm far away from any city.

How those brigands came and kill her family and took her away.

She told me that she has nothing to return at that farm and no one else to return to as well.

She suddenly went down to her knees and plead to me to take her into my service.

"Please my lord! I have no one to return to. Please take me into your service."

"I will do everything you ask from me. Please!" said while sobbing.

We leave those unlucky villagers with heavy hearts.

I could see the disappointment in all the soldiers eyes.

I might have save them from a unnecessary danger but the look in their eyes told me something else.

They were all willing to fight.

But our priority was our mission and we all knew there will be many dangers we must face before our journey ends.

Whether they understood me or not i have made my decision.

The hermit was glad that i accepted his offer.

At night he started to concentrate on the campfire. 

To the ever changing flames and smoke and the fumes that come out of that camp fire.

Then suddenly he raised his head to the clear night sky to see the stars.

"To the north..." he said, "i see three kings rapidly changing."

"And a son, praying to gods and apologizing..."

"Not soon but finally he is forgiven..."

He took a long breath and continued.

"To the south..." he said, "i see many kings, powerful, great kings."

"I see the land prosper under their rule."

"Kings of the north and kings of the south... I see them fight."

"And i see them become brothers as well."

"Thats all i see..." and he exhaled with sudden exhaustion.

He smiled as embarressed and said " I am sorry my prince."

"Prophetic visions are than to be not comprehensible as we want them to be."

With a sincere apology he excused himself for the night.

I thanked him with a confused mind and pondered upon the words he said till i finally fall asleep.

Next day we make farewells to each other and the hermits went on the their pilgrimage.

I could see the dissapointment in the Hermits eyes.

But it quickly changed into understanding.

"You may be wiser than us, my lord."

"Knowing ones fortune does not help but may hinder sometimes."

"I have wanted to offer a little help out of gratitude for your hospitality."

"But in my goodwill i might cause harm to you."

"You have my thanks, my wise prince."

Next day we make farewells to each other and the hermits went on the their pilgrimage.

We march through the lands of Kemet.

After a few days scouts return with bad news.

<<set_dialog_image battle>>

There was an welcoming commitee coming down to our way just beyond the hills in front of us.

Tarkuwa draws his sword and said "My prince, let me take half of my men and clash with them."

"You should continue with the others and we will meet with you after we are done with them."

"I promise."

[[Ok! But don't forget your promise. Kill them and return victorious my friend!|DecoyAfterAttack]]

We draw our swords and prepare ourselves to coming battle.

Men were anxious but ready to fight.

We didn't have to wait much. 

There wasn't any talk. It started with arrows flying and soon men clashed with their sword and axes and daggers.

I'm not sure how long it took.

It took long enough. Long enough to destroy everyone.

As the dust was settling down around me i tried to see if anyone survived.

A handful of people that survied gathered around me. They looked confused as i was. I had to got myself together and i had to do it fast.

Quickly check who were alive and who were dead.

Tarkuwa! My beloved friend! He was lying on the ground with several dead enemy soldiers around him.

Hattu-Zilli was dead too. Not many spared from this bloodshed.

<<if $dog_companion == true>>
That dog too fight for me until its last breath. Truely a loyal companion! 
<<endif>>

I wasn't sure that i have deserved such loyal friends.

<<if $girl_companion == true>>
With some blind luck the girl we saved could survived all this.

The girl came to me and speak "My lord, forgive me if i am out of line but i have a suggestion for you."

"My family's farm is not so far away from here. If you want you can take refuge there."

I couldn't return to Hattusa in defeat and i was sure if i continue on this road more enemies would be waiting for me before i reach to the capital.

There weren't many options laid out for me. Maybe, maybe i should choose a different way.

<<endif>>

A few remained survivors was looking up to me to decide what to do next.

Though i really wasn't sure what should i do next.

In lands of Canaan while avoiding the enemy following us we trailed on and on.

Finally we ran out of food and had to take our chances.

Then the enemy didn't let this opportunity go and made their attack.

Starved, weary and desperate as we, still tried to put a fight on. 

But we were outmatched and quickly killed to the last man.

Thus ended my tale. Zannanza, the hittite prince died here.

"So i release you from your bonds. You are free to go wherever you want. Thank you for all your service."

"For i, Zannanza, the prince of Hattusha dies here and i shall leave this place as a new man."

"So it shall be known as from now on."

After i let my soldiers go i took the farm girls hand and let her guide me to my new life.
