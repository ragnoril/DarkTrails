# DarkTrails

An old rpg engine project long since abandoned. Hopefully one day I would start another project and use my experiences - good and bad - from this one to make it much better.

It is developed as a modular game engine whose every module handles different mechanics of the game. Each module developed with the MVC architecture in mind.

There are several modules in here to showcase they are easily interchangable. Such as 2d and 3d combat modules and 2d and 3d world travel module. 

For combat modules only the viewer parts needed to change but world travel modules written entirely seperately. 

Older version of Yarn Spinner used for the dialogue module.
